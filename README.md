# last.fm-last-played-tracks-rainmeter-skin
Code for a Rainmeter skin that displays last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 last scrobbled tracks. This is a fork of "Last.fm Rainmeter Skin VERSION 2.0" (a.k.a. "Watcha listenin' 2") by Blaise.

Version history:

1.0 (May 13, 2023)
- Initial commit.
- Updated the original skin (small version only) to support up to 10 last played tracks.
- Switched track title and artist fields.
- Added a background.
- Unescaped the special characters in song urls.
- Limited the title/artist/album length to 35 characters.
- Replaced the placeholder icon.

1.01 (May 13, 2023)
- Increased the displayed character limit for artist and album tags. First release.

Known issues:
- The skin stops loading data after too many manual refreshes. This has been an issue in the original skin as well.
- The username needs to be set for each variant separately. Unfortunately, I don't see how I can resolve this. The original skin asked to input a username 3 times during editing in any variant.

To do:
- Make a right-aligned version.
- Make variants for more tracks (I only have a 1080p display so I can't test all of them)
- Fork different sized versions of the original skin, I only used the small version.
